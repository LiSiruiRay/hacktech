      "event_content": "In Q1 2025, major corporations faced volatility amid trade tensions, tariffs, and global uncertainties. Tesla, despite missing earnings, surged 80% over the past year due to autonomous vehicle ambitions, while automakers like BYD plan aggressive expansion into Asia.

Meanwhile, defense and aerospace firms such as Lockheed and Boeing exceeded expectations with robust sales and strategic deals. Cryptocurrency adoption increased with new ETFs and blockchain projects, but concerns surrounding regulation and organized crime persist. Overall, markets have experienced sharp swings, with investors evaluating long-term opportunities in AI, energy, and select blue chips, amidst geopolitical and trade-induced volatility.",
