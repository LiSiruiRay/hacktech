    print(topic_generator("In April 2025, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it would pause interest rate hikes after nearly two years of aggressive tightening aimed at combating inflation. This decision came after several months of cooling inflation data and growing concerns about a potential recession. Following the announcement, U.S. equity markets rallied sharply, with the S&P 500 gaining 3% in a single day â€” its best performance since early 2023. Treasury yields dropped as investors began pricing in future rate cuts, and the dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies."))
